Scenario 1: Test Initialization of DifferentLocationChecker

Details:
  TestName: testDifferentLocationCheckerInitialization
  Description: The test is meant to check the successful initialization of a DifferentLocationChecker object.
Execution:
  Arrange: No input data is required to be set up as the method doesn't take any inputs.
  Act: Invoke the differentLocationChecker() method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned object is not null and is an instance of DifferentLocationChecker.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that a DifferentLocationChecker object was correctly initialized. This is part of testing the most basic behaviour of the method; if the method cannot initialize a DifferentLocationChecker object, then further testing is moot.

Scenario 2: Test the Independence of DifferentLocationChecker Objects

Details:
  TestName: testDifferentLocationCheckerObjectIndependence
  Description: The test is meant to check that each invocation of differentLocationChecker() method returns a separate DifferentLocationChecker object.
Execution:
  Arrange: No input data is required to be set up as the method doesn't take any inputs.
  Act: Invoke the differentLocationChecker() method twice, storing each returned object.
  Assert: Assert that the two returned objects are not the same using JUnit's assertNotSame method.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that differentLocationChecker() does not return references to the same object. This is to ensure that each invocation of differentLocationChecker() will not have side effects on other invocations, indicating correct functionality.
