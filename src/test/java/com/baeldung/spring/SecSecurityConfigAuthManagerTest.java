Scenario 1: Successful AuthenticationManager construction
Details:
TestName: testSuccessfulAuthManagerConstruction
Description: This test should validate whether the AuthenticationManager is constructed correctly when provided with the correct HttpSecurity and authentication provider.
Execution:
Arrange: Mock HttpSecurity and AuthenticationManagerBuilder instances, along with an actual instance of an authentication provider.
Act: Invoke the method authManager with the mock HttpSecurity.
Assert: Verify that an instance of AuthenticationManager has been returned by comparing the actual object against the expected object.
Validation:
The assertion checks that the returned AuthenticationManager is constructed as expected. It's important because this manager is fundamental for user authentication functionality.

Scenario 2: Null HttpSecurity
Details:
TestName: testNullHttpSecurity
Description: This test should confirm that the method handles a null HttpSecurity parameter and throws an appropriate exception.
Execution:
Arrange: A null value for HttpSecurity.
Act: Invoke authManager with null.
Assert: Expect an exception to be thrown.
Validation:
The test confirms that the function behaves correctly upon receiving a null HttpSecurity. The method should fail early and loudly to prevent obscure errors further down the execution.

Scenario 3: Null AuthenticationProvider
Details:
TestName: testNullAuthenticationProvider
Description: This test checks that the method appropriately handles when No authentication provider is provided.
Execution:
Arrange: Provide a HttpSecurity object but mock the authProvider method to return null.
Act: Invoke authManager with the HttpSecurity instance.
Assert: Assert that an exception will be thrown.
Validation:
This test ensures that the method can handle a scenario when the authentication provider is not available, and correctly throws an exception. This scenario could happen due to configuration mistakes.

Scenario 4: Invalid Type for AuthenticationProvider
Details:
TestName: testInvalidAuthenticationProviderType
Description: Verify that the function throws an exception when an authentication provider of an invalid type is provided.
Execution:
Arrange: Provide HttpSecurity and an inappropriate type for AuthenticationProvider.
Act: Invoke the method authManager.
Assert: Check that an exception is thrown.
Validation:
This important scenario is aimed at ensuring that the method reacts properly to receiving an inappropriate authentication provider. It should not attempt to construct an AuthenticationManager in such cases, preventing potential security vulnerabilities.
