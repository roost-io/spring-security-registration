  Scenario 1: Valid Creation of CustomRememberMeServices

  Details:
    TestName: testValidCreationOfCustomRememberMeServices
    Description: Verify whether the CustomRememberMeServices is properly initialized with expected values (theKey, userDetailsService, new InMemoryTokenRepositoryImpl()).

  Execution:
    Arrange: Create instance of UserDetailsService and assign to userDetailsService.
    Act: Run rememberMeServices() method.
    Assert: Check the instance returned is not null and is an instance of CustomRememberMeServices.
  Validation:
    This assertion checks if CustomRememberMeServices is created successfully and rightly initialized with a key and UserDetailsService. This is important to ensure the essential configurations for remember-me functionality are set properly.


  Scenario 2: Validate the RememberMe Key

  Details:
    TestName: testValidRememberMeKey
    Description: Verify if the key used in CustomRememberMeServices is valid and as expected ("theKey").

  Execution:
    Arrange: Create instance of UserDetailsService and assign to userDetailsService.
    Act: Run rememberMeServices() to get an instance of CustomRememberMeServices.
    Assert: Use getter method getCookieName() to retrieve key and compare it against "theKey".
  Validation:
    This assertion is to validate if correct key is utilized to create the CustomRememberMeServices instance. The correct key is needed for valid remember-me functionality.


  Scenario 3: Validate UserDetailsService in RememberMeServices

  Details:
    TestName: testUserDetailsServiceInRememberMeServices
    Description: Verify if the assigned UserDetailsService in CustomRememberMeServices is the one as provided at instance creation.

  Execution:
    Arrange: Create instance of UserDetailsService and assign to userDetailsService.
    Act: run rememberMeServices() to get an instance of CustomRememberMeServices.
    Assert: Use getter method getUserDetailsService() to retrieve the UserDetailsService instance and check if it is same as userDetailsService provided at time of creation.
  Validation:
    This test is important to verify the UserDetailsService assigned correctly as it is key to user authentication.


  Scenario 4: Validate TokenRepository in RememberMeServices

  Details:
    TestName: testTokenRepositoryInRememberMeServices
    Description: Verify if the InMemoryTokenRepository used in CustomRememberMeServices is correctly set.

  Execution:
    Arrange: Create instance of UserDetailsService and assign to userDetailsService.
    Act: Run rememberMeServices() to get an instance of CustomRememberMeServices.
    Assert: Use getter method getTokenRepository() to retrieve TokenRepository instance and verify it is an instance of InMemoryTokenRepositoryImpl.
  Validation:
    This test is important to confirm the correct TokenRepository is set for managing the tokens of remember-me functionality.
