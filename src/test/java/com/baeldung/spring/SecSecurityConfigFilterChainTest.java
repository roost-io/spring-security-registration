 * """ Scenario 1: Validate valid staff accessing roleHierarchy
 *
 * Details: TestName: testValidStaffAccessingRoleHierarchy Description: Test for when a
 * valid staff member is accessing the /roleHierarchy URL. The user has a STAFF role.
 * Execution: Arrange: Mock a staff member with a STAFF role and a GET request to the
 * /roleHierarchy URL. Act: Invoke the filterChain method. Assert: Verify that the HTTP
 * status of the response is OK (200). Validation: Assert the status is OK to confirm that
 * staff users can access the /roleHierarchy. This conforms to application behavior that
 * only staff should have access to this endpoint.
 *
 * Scenario 2: Invalid staff accessing roleHierarchy
 *
 * Details: TestName: testInvalidStaffAccessingRoleHierarchy Description: Test for when an
 * invalid staff member(i.e., user not having the STAFF role) is accessing the
 * /roleHierarchy URL. Execution: Arrange: Mock a user without STAFF role placing a GET
 * request to the /roleHierarchy URL. Act: Invoke the filterChain method. Assert: Verify
 * that the HTTP status of the response is Unauthorized (401). Validation: Asserting
 * Unauthorized status to confirm that only users with STAFF role can access the
 * /roleHierarchyendpoint. This reflects the application security requirement.
 *
 * Scenario 3: User without required authority for updatePassword
 *
 * Details: TestName: testUserWithoutRequiredAuthorityForUpdatePassword Description: Test
 * for a user without CHANGE_PASSWORD_PRIVILEGE trying to access the /user/updatePassword*
 * endpoint. Execution: Arrange: Mock a user without CHANGE_PASSWORD_PRIVILEGE placing a
 * request to the /user/updatePassword* endpoint. Act: Invoke the filterChain method.
 * Assert: Verify that the HTTP status of the response is Unauthorized (401). Validation:
 * Asserting Unauthorized status confirms that users without required authority cannot
 * access /user/updatePassword* endpoint which aligns with our application's security
 * requirement.
 *
 * Scenario 4: Success login redirection
 *
 * Details: TestName: testSuccessLoginRedirection Description: Test to ensure correct
 * redirection URL after a successful login. Execution: Arrange: Mock a successful
 * authentication activity from a user and define "/homepage.html" as the success URL.
 * Act: Invoke the filterChain method. Assert: Verify the redirection mechanism points to
 * "/homepage.html" upon successful login. Validation: Asserting the redirection URL
 * checks if the application correctly redirects users after successful login which is
 * crucial for user navigation in the website.
 *
 * Scenario 5: Remember me functionality test
 *
 * Details: TestName: testRememberMeFunctionality Description: Test to verify that
 * 'remember me' functionality is working as expected. Execution: Arrange: Mock a remember
 * me activity from a user. Act: Invoke the filterChain method. Assert: Verify that
 * 'remember me' cookie is set in the response. Validation: Asserting the 'remember me'
 * cookie is crucial to ensure the application correctly remembers the user and can
 * provide personalized user experience. """
