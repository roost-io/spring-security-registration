ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=passwordEncoder_27de5b4d13

Scenario 1: Test to Check if the PasswordEncoder Object is successfully created

Details:
  TestName: testPasswordEncoderObjectCreation
  Description: This test is meant to check if the passwordEncoder method is successfully creating a PasswordEncoder object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup data necessary for this test.
    Act: Invoke the passwordEncoder method without parameters.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the returned object is instance of PasswordEncoder.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the passwordEncoder method successfully creates an instance of the PasswordEncoder object. This test is significant because it ensures the method is correctly implemented to create the necessary object.

Scenario 2: Test to Check if the PasswordEncoder Object has the BCryptPasswordEncoder Instance

Details:
  TestName: testPasswordEncoderInstance
  Description: This test is meant to verify if the passwordEncoder method is creating an instance of BCryptPasswordEncoder. It checks the specific functionality of the passwordEncoder method that uses BCryptPasswordEncoder.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup data necessary for this test.
    Act: Invoke the passwordEncoder method without parameters.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the returned object is instance of BCryptPasswordEncoder.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the PasswordEncoder object created by the method is an instance of BCryptPasswordEncoder. This is important because BCryptPasswordEncoder is expected from the method's implementation.

Scenario 3: Test to Check if the Strength of BCryptPasswordEncoder is 11

Details:
  TestName: testBCryptPasswordEncoderStrength
  Description: This test is meant to verify if the strength of the BCryptPasswordEncoder created by the passwordEncoder method is 11. It checks the specific functionality of the passwordEncoder method to set the strength of BCryptPasswordEncoder to 11.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup data necessary for this test.
    Act: Invoke the passwordEncoder method without parameters.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the strength of the returned object is 11.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the strength of BCryptPasswordEncoder is set to 11, as per the method's implementation. It is significant because it checks if the method has correctly assigned the strength during object creation.
