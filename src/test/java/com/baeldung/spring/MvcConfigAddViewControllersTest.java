Scenario 1: Default login view mapping

Details:  
  TestName: defaultLoginViewControllerMapping
  Description: This test verifies that the "/" view controller has been correctly mapped to forward to "/login". 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock ViewControllerRegistry.
  Act: Call the method addViewControllers with the mocked registry.
  Assert: Assert that registry.addViewController("/") is set to "forward:/login".
Validation: 
  This verifies that the default "/" endpoint is correctly redirected to "/login". The expected result is that the view name for "/" is "forward:/login". This ensures the application is pointing to the correct initial login page when accessed.

Scenario 2: Validate view controller registration

Details:
  TestName: validateViewControllerRegistration
  Description: This test checks that all the view controllers are registered correctly by invoking the addViewControllers method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock ViewControllerRegistry.
  Act: Call the method addViewControllers passing the mock registry as an argument.
  Assert: Assert that registry.addViewController is called for each of the expected view controller paths (eg. "/loginRememberMe", "/registration.html", etc...).
Validation:
  This verifies that each view controller path is correctly registered. The significance of this test is to ensure that all view paths are correctly mapped and available.

Scenario 3: Exception when registry is null

Details:
  TestName: handleNullRegistryInput
  Description: This test checks whether the addViewControllers correctly handles a null input for registry.
Execution:
  Arrange: Do not setup any data, there is no registry to mock in this case.
  Act: Call the addViewControllers method with null as the argument.
  Assert: Catch any exception thrown and assert that it is an instance of NullPointerException or any other expected exception.
Validation: 
  This verifies that the function can handle null inputs correctly. The expected result is that when registry is null, an exception should be thrown. It tests the robustness of the function against incorrect inputs. 

Scenario 4: Error when invalid view name is specified

Details:
  TestName: handleInvalidViewName
  Description: This test checks that the addViewControllers method correctly handles an invalid view name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a mock ViewControllerRegistry that throws an exception when a particular method is called.
  Act: Call the method addViewControllers with the mocked registry.
  Assert: Catch any exception thrown and assert that it is an instance of the expected type.
Validation: 
  This verifies the resilience of the function when faced with incorrect or missing view names. The expected result is that an exception should be thrown.
