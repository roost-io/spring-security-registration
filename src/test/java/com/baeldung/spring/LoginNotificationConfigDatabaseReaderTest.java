"""
  Scenario 1: Valid Database File Present in Classpath

  Details:  
    TestName: testDatabaseFilePresentInClasspath
    Description: In this test scenario, a valid database file is present in the exact location in the classpath as mentioned in the method. This checks if the method can properly access and use the DatabaseReader Builder with the correct path provided.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock for ResourceUtils to return a valid File object pointing to "maxmind/GeoLite2-City.mmdb" path.
    Act: Invoke the databaseReader method.
    Assert: use AssertNotNull to ensures that DatabaseReader object is not null.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that when a valid database file is present, the method should be able to construct the DatabaseReader object successfully. This test is significant to ensure the method can handle the normal, anticipated use case properly. 
  
  Scenario 2: Database File Not Present in Classpath

  Details:  
    TestName: testDatabaseFileAbsentInClasspath
    Description: In this scenario, the database file is not present in the classpath. This is to test how the method reacts when it cannot find the file at the path provided.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock for ResourceUtils to throw a FileNotFoundException.
    Act: Invoke the databaseReader method.
    Assert: Use ExpectedException rule to check for the FileNotFoundException.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that when the file is not present, the method throws a FileNotFoundException as expected. This test helps to make sure the method has the correct error handling capabilities. 

  Scenario 3: Invalid Database File in Classpath

  Details:  
    TestName: testInvalidDatabaseFileInClasspath
    Description: In this scenario, an invalid (corrupted, or wrong format) database file is present in the classpath. This is to test if the method can handle unexpected file content.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a mock for ResourceUtils to return a File object pointing to an invalid "maxmind/GeoLite2-City.mmdb" database file.
    Act: Invoke the databaseReader method.
    Assert: use ExpectedException rule to check for IOException.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that when an invalid file is present, the method throws an IOException as expected. This scenario is important in ensuring the method can handle edge cases correctly.
