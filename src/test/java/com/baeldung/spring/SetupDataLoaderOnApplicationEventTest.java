"""
Scenario 1: Test for successful application event start

Details:
    TestName: testSuccessfulApplicationEventStart
    Description: This test checks if the onApplicationEvent method works as expected during the system startup.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Mock the ContextRefreshedEvent event and other required dependencies.
    Act: Call the onApplicationEvent(event).
    Assert: Check if privileges and roles were created and initial user was set up.
  Validation:
    The assertion checks if the method correctly initializes the privileges, roles, and first user every time an application startup event is triggered. This test is significant in ensuring the setup phase of the application works correctly.

Scenario 2: Test for successive application events

Details:
    TestName: testAlreadySetupCondition
    Description: This test checks if the onApplicationEvent method correctly handles consecutive application start events.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Invoke onApplicationEvent once to set alreadySetup to true.
    Act: Call the onApplicationEvent again.
    Assert: Assert that the roles, privileges, and user setup methods are not invoked the second time.
  Validation:
    The assertion checks if the setup operations were not performed again for successive application start events. This test ensures optimal behavior in case the method is accidentally called multiple times. The significance of this test can be seen in certain automated deployments and containerization scenarios.

Scenario 3: Test for correct creation of privileges.

Details:
    TestName: testPrivilegeCreation
    Description: This test checks if the onApplicationEvent method creates the correct set of privileges.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize the ContextRefreshedEvent, mock the required dependencies.
    Act: Call the onApplicationEvent(event).
    Assert: Check if the correct set of Privileges (READ_PRIVILEGE, WRITE_PRIVILEGE, CHANGE_PASSWORD_PRIVILEGE) were created.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies if correct privileges have been created during setup. The test is significant for the correct working of authorization within the application.

Scenario 4: Test for correct assignment of privileges to roles.

Details:
    TestName: testRoleCreation
    Description: This test checks if the onApplicationEvent method correctly assigns privileges to roles.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize the ContextRefreshedEvent, mock the required dependencies.
    Act: Call the onApplicationEvent(event).
    Assert: Check if the created roles have the correct privileges assigned.
  Validation:
    The assertion checks if the correct privileges were assigned to the roles during setup. This is significant for maintaining the defined authorization schema for the users.
