Scenario 1: Testing successful creation of Role Hierarchy
Details:
    TestName: testRoleHierarchyCreation
    Description: This test is meant to check if the role hierarchy is correctly set.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No specific data setup required as no parameters are needed for the roleHierarchy method.
    Act: Invoke the roleHierarchy method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if the hierarchy set in the method "ROLE_ADMIN > ROLE_STAFF \n ROLE_STAFF > ROLE_USER" matches the expected hierarchy.
  Validation:
    This assertion verifies that a role hierarchy is created and set successfully. This is required to maintain a hierarchy of roles within the application as per the business logic.

Scenario 2: Testing Role Hierarchy Structure
Details:
    TestName: testRoleHierarchyStructure
    Description: This test is meant to verify that the hierarchy structure of roles defined in roleHierarchy() method is maintained.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No specific data setup required.
    Act: Invoke the roleHierarchy method and get the hierarchy roles in an ordered List.
    Assert: Verify that "ROLE_ADMIN", "ROLE_STAFF" and "ROLE_USER" exist in the hierarchy and that "ROLE_ADMIN" is above "ROLE_STAFF" and "ROLE_STAFF" is above "ROLE_USER" in the list.
  Validation:
    The assertion validates that the hierarchy is maintained as specified in business logic. This is to ensure that each hierarchical role has its proper permissions and authorities.

Scenario 3: Testing Role Hierarchy Assignment
Details:
    TestName: testRoleHierarchyAssignment
    Description: This test is meant to verify whether higher roles include the authorities of lower roles in the hierarchy.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No specific data setup required.
    Act: Invoke the roleHierarchy method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare if authorities assigned to the "ROLE_ADMIN" also includes authorities of "ROLE_STAFF" and "ROLE_USER" and "ROLE_STAFF" includes "ROLE_USER" authorities.
  Validation:
    The assertion validates that the authorities are correctly inherited in the hierarchy. This is to make sure users with high privileges also have access to operations available to users with lower roles.

Scenario 4: Testing Null Role Hierarchy
Details:
    TestName: testNullRoleHierarchy
    Description: This is a negative test meant to verify behavior when a null role hierarchy is created.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Update the roleHierarchy method to return a null role hierarchy.
    Act: Invoke the roleHierarchy method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify if a NullPointerException is thrown.
  Validation:
    The assertion is aiming to verify that the application handles a null role hierarchy appropriately, as a null role hierarchy could potentially break the application. This test case validates proper exception handling.
