Here are the JUnit test scenarios for the httpSessionEventPublisher method:

Scenario 1: Verify HttpSessionEventPublisher Instance Creation

Details:
  TestName: httpSessionEventPublisherInstanceCreation
  Description: This test verifies that the httpSessionEventPublisher method creates and returns a new instance of HttpSessionEventPublisher.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement required.
  Act: Invoke the httpSessionEventPublisher method.
  Assert: Assert that the returned object is an instance of HttpSessionEventPublisher using assertNotNull and assertTrue with instanceof.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly creates and returns a new instance of HttpSessionEventPublisher.
  This test ensures that the basic functionality of the method is working as expected.

Scenario 2: Verify HttpSessionEventPublisher Instance Uniqueness

Details:
  TestName: httpSessionEventPublisherInstanceUniqueness
  Description: This test verifies that each invocation of the httpSessionEventPublisher method returns a new and unique instance of HttpSessionEventPublisher.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement required.
  Act: Invoke the httpSessionEventPublisher method twice and store the returned instances in separate variables.
  Assert: Assert that the two instances are not the same object using assertNotSame.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies that each invocation of the method creates a new and unique instance of HttpSessionEventPublisher.
  This test ensures that the method does not return a shared or cached instance, which is important for proper session event handling.

Scenario 3: Verify HttpSessionEventPublisher Instance Properties

Details:
  TestName: httpSessionEventPublisherInstanceProperties
  Description: This test verifies that the HttpSessionEventPublisher instance returned by the method has the expected default properties.
Execution:
  Arrange: No specific arrangement required.
  Act: Invoke the httpSessionEventPublisher method and store the returned instance in a variable.
  Assert: Assert that the instance's properties, such as sessionListeners and sessionIdListeners, are not null and have the expected initial state (e.g., empty collections).
Validation:
  The assertions verify that the created HttpSessionEventPublisher instance has the expected default properties.
  This test ensures that the instance is properly initialized and ready for use without any unexpected modifications.

Scenario 4: Verify HttpSessionEventPublisher Instance Thread Safety

Details:
  TestName: httpSessionEventPublisherInstanceThreadSafety
  Description: This test verifies that multiple threads can safely invoke the httpSessionEventPublisher method concurrently without causing any race conditions or inconsistencies.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create multiple threads that will concurrently invoke the httpSessionEventPublisher method.
  Act: Start all the threads simultaneously and let them invoke the method concurrently. Collect the returned instances from each thread.
  Assert: Assert that all the collected instances are unique and not null using assertNotNull and assertTrue with instanceof for each instance.
Validation:
  The assertions verify that concurrent invocations of the method do not cause any issues and that each thread receives its own unique instance of HttpSessionEventPublisher.
  This test ensures that the method is thread-safe and can be used in a multi-threaded environment without causing any conflicts or inconsistencies.

Note: The provided test scenarios assume that the httpSessionEventPublisher method is a simple factory method that creates and returns a new instance of HttpSessionEventPublisher. If there are any additional behaviors or dependencies involved, the test scenarios may need to be adjusted accordingly.
