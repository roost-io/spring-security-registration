"""
Scenario 1: Test if HttpSessionEventPublisher works successfully.

Details:
    TestName: testHttpSessionEventPublisherSuccessfullyWorks
    Description: This test ensures that the method httpSessionEventPublisher returns a new instance of HttpSessionEventPublisher and does not return null or throws any exception.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No necessary data to arrange since httpSessionEventPublisher does not take parameters.
    Act: Invoke httpSessionEventPublisher method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to validate that the result is not null.
  Validation:
    Make sure that a new instance of HttpSessionEventPublisher does get created. This is important to confirm that the method is working as expected and is ready to handle any upcoming HTTP session events.

Scenario 2: Test if HttpSessionEventPublisher can handle thrown exceptions.

Details:
    TestName: testHttpSessionEventPublisherExceptionHandling
    Description: This test ensures that if any exception is thrown during the creation of HttpSessionEventPublisher, it is properly propagated and can be caught in the test.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No necessary data to prepare since httpSessionEventPublisher does not take parameters.
    Act: Invoke httpSessionEventPublisher method in a context where an exception is expected to be thrown (could involve mocking).
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to expect and handle the exception.
  Validation:
    This helps to verify the robustness of the code and how it handles unexpected situations or errors. Exception handling is crucial to the stability of any system and needs to be tested thoroughly.

Note: HttpSessionEventPublisher doesn't have much in terms of functionality since it only instantiates an object without any input or configuration. Most real-world methods will have parameters, interactions with databases or external services, etc. Those types of methods would have more comprehensive tests for different inputs, parameter combinations, interactions, etc.
