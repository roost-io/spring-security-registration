================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: Usage of HTTP GET methods can result in exposure of sensitive information in the request's query string. Since the information is in the query string, it could end up in logs or shared through 'referrer' headers.
Solution: Use HTTP POST methods instead of GET methods if the request is manipulating data. Make sure that sensitive information is never used as parameters in GET methods.

Vulnerability: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
Issue: If user input is included into web pages without proper sanitization, an attacker could execute malicious scripts in a victim's web browser.
Solution: Ensure all user-generated input included in a web page is encoded or appropriately sanitized before it is returned to the user's web browser.

Vulnerability: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
Issue: If user-supplied information is inserted into SQL queries without being properly sanitized, an attacker could manipulate the application's queries.
Solution: Use parameterized queries or prepared statements to mitigate SQL injection risks. This ensures that user input is never directly added to an SQL query string.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Check Normal Execution 
   
Details:  
    TestName: checkNormalExecution
    Description: This test is meant to check that the getSite method executes normally and returns expected string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement is needed since this method is a simple getter.
    Act: Invoke the getSite() without passing any parameters. 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare actual result against expected output.
  Validation: 
    Assertion aims to verify if the method returns expected string.
    The test verifies that getSite() is correctly returning site's value in normal situations.

Scenario 2: Check Null Site 
  
Details:  
    TestName: checkNullSite
    Description: This test is to validate that getSite() can handle null as site's value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up the value of site as null. 
    Act: Invoke the getSite().
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the return value is null.
  Validation: 
    Assertion aims to check that the method is correctly handling the null value.
    The importance of the test lies in making sure that the application doesn't crash when getSite() encounters null as a site's value.

Scenario 3: Check Empty String site

Details:
    TestName: checkEmptyStringSite
    Description: This test is to inspect that getSite() returns an empty string when site's value is set to an empty string.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the site's value as an empty string.  
    Act: Invoke the getSite(). 
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the return is indeed an empty string.
  Validation:
    The assertion aims to prove that the method handles the empty string value properly.
    The test ensures that the getSite() is correctly returning an empty string when site's value is an empty string.

Scenario 4: Check Non-English Characters Site
   
Details:  
    TestName: checkNonEnglishCharactersSite
    Description: This test is to verify that getSite() can handle non-English characters as site's value.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Input non-English characters as site's value. 
    Act: Call the getSite().
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to confirm that the method returns the non-English characters as is.
  Validation: 
    Assertion aims to verify that getSite() handles non-English characters correctly.
    The significance of this test is to make sure that the getSite() works with internationalization.
