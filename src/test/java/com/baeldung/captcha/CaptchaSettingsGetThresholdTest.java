================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Use of Public Variable Without Access Control
Issue: The class com.baeldung.captcha has a public float 'threshold' without any access control. This leaves the application susceptible to potential data tampering from malicious code.
Solution: Use private variable and provide public getter and setter methods. Always consider minimizing the visibility of your classes and members, and avoid exposing mutable reference to the client.

Vulnerability: CWE-330: Use of Insufficiently Random Values
Issue: Since the class 'com.baeldung.captcha' indicates use of Captcha service, if any random values are being generated without suitable randomness, it may result in predictable values which can be exploited by an attacker.
Solution: Ensure that any random numbers or values are generated using a securely random function.

Vulnerability: CWE-749: Exposed Dangerous Method or Function
Issue: If the method getThreshold() returns reference to the private mutable object, it exposes the internals of the class. This can leak sensitive information.
Solution: Avoid exposing internals of the class with accessors. Instead of returning a reference to the private mutable object, return a copy of the object.

================================================================================
""" 
  Scenario 1: Testing the Normal Case

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetThreshold
    Description: This test will check if the method getThreshold is returning the correct value. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup required as no dependent data. 
    Act: Invoke the getThreshold() method. 
    Assert: Check if the returned value matches the expected value.
  Validation: 
    The assertion validates that the method returns the correct threshold value. This is important as it confirms the accurate functionality of the getThreshold method.

  Scenario 2: Testing the Edge Case - Zero Threshold

  Details:  
    TestName: testZeroThreshold
    Description: This test will verify the behaviour of the method when the threshold is set to zero. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the threshold as zero.
    Act: Invoke the getThreshold() method. 
    Assert: Check the returned value to see if it is zero.
  Validation: 
    Assertion confirms that the method can correctly retrieve a zero threshold. This is important because it validates the method's ability to handle the edge case where the threshold is zero.

  Scenario 3: Testing the Edge Case - Maximum Threshold

  Details:  
    TestName: testMaxThreshold
    Description: This test would test the edge case where the threshold is at its max acceptable limit. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the threshold as the maximum acceptable limit.
    Act: Invoke the getThreshold() method. 
    Assert: Check the returned value to see if it is the same as the maximum limit.
  Validation: 
    This assertion validates that the method can correctly retrieve a maximum threshold. This tests the boundary value of the threshold variable.

  Scenario 4: Testing the Edge Case - Negative Threshold

  Details: 
    TestName: testNegativeThreshold
    Description: This test checks if the getThreshold method correctly retrieves a negative threshold, depending on your application's requirements.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the threshold value to be a negative number.
    Act: Invoke the getThreshold() method.
    Assert: Check the returned value; it should be the same negative number we set.
  Validation:
    The test will confirm the ability of the getThreshold method to correctly retrieve the threshold even if it is a negative number. This test is dependent on the specific requirements and rules of your application, which might allow for a negative threshold.
