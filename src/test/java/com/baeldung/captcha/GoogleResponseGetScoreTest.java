================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Uncontrolled Logging (CWE-117)
Issue: Sensitive information can accidentally end up in logs, especially if exceptions and stack traces are being logged by default.
Solution: You should control what information ends up in your program's logs. Make sure to remove or mask sensitive information (like passwords, personally identifiable information etc.).

Vulnerability: Insecure Third-party Libraries (CWE-1104)
Issue: Your program can have vulnerabilities inserted by insecure third-party libraries. In this case, you're using a Jason Web Token library.
Solution: Regularly check and update the libraries you use, and consider using a software composition analysis tool to help check for vulnerabilities in your libraries.

Vulnerability: Java Deserialization Vulnerability (CWE-502)
Issue: If your application deserializes untrusted data, attackers can cause a denial of service, execute arbitrary commands or even complete takeover of the system.
Solution: Don't deserialize untrusted data. Employ alternatives like JSON, or use safe serialization libraries that validate the objects during deserialization such as using a whitelist.

"""
  Scenario 1: Test to get the Score

  Details:
    TestName: testGetScore
    Description: This test is to check the basic functionality of the getScore method by invoking it and verifying that it returns the correct score.

  Execution:
    Arrange: Nothing to arrange as getScore() method does not take any input.
    Act: Invoke the getScore method.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value matches the expected score.

  Validation:
    This test verifies that the getScore method works as expected and returns the correct score. This is crucial because the score is likely used in multiple areas of the application, so it should always accurately reflect the current score.

  Scenario 2: Check for available score 

  Details:  
    TestName: testScoreAvailable
    Description: This test is meant to check if a score is available by invoking the getScore method.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Nothing to arrange as getScore() doesn't take any parameters.
    Act: Invoke the getScore method.
    Assert: Use JUnit's assertNotEquals to validate that the score is not zero.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that a score is available. This is important in the context of an application because it assures that scoring is functioning and that users are being awarded points.

  Scenario 3: Check for score precision

  Details:  
    TestName: testScorePrecision
    Description: The test will check if the score is precisely up to the floating point.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Nothing to arrange as getScore() doesn't take any parameters.
    Act: Invoke the getScore method.
    Assert: Use JUnit's assertEquals with an epsilon to validate that the score is a Float and has the required precision.
  Validation: 
    This assertion verifies that the score maintains precision up to a floating point. This is important because it confirms that the scoring system is precise and doesn't lose accuracy over time.
