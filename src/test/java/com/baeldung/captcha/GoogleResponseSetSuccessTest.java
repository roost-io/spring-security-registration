""" 
  Scenario 1: Verifying the assignment of true value to the success variable.

  Details:  
    TestName: testSuccessValueSetToTrue
    Description: This test is designed to verify that the setSuccess method correctly allows the assignment of a true value to the success variable.
  
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a boolean variable with true value.
    Act: Call the setSuccess method by passing the initialized boolean variable.
    Assert: Assert whether the success variable is true.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the success variable is indeed set to true. This test ensures that the method can update the success variable correctly to true.

  """
  
  """ 
  Scenario 2: Verifying the assignment of false value to the success variable.

  Details:  
    TestName: testSuccessValueSetToFalse
    Description: This test is designed to verify that the setSuccess method correctly allows the assignment of a false value to the success variable.
  
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize a boolean variable with false value.
    Act: Call the setSuccess method by passing the initialized boolean variable.
    Assert: Assert whether the success variable is false.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the success variable is indeed set to false. This test ensures that the method can update the success variable correctly to false.

  """

  """ 
  Scenario 3: Verifying the state of the success variable by assigning the true value after previously assigning the false value.

  Details:  
    TestName: testSuccessValueChangedToTrue
    Description: This test aims to check if the setSuccess method can update the success variable to true from a previously false state.
  
  Execution:
    Arrange: Initially set the success variable to false. Then, Initialize another boolean variable with a true value.
    Act: Call the setSuccess method by passing the initialized boolean variable.
    Assert: Assert whether the success variable is true.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the success variable has been updated from the false to the true state. The test verifies the method's ability to modify the success variable as per changes in conditions or requirements.
