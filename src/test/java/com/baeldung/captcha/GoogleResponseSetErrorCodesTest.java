================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: Insecure Deserialization (CWE-502)
Issue: If your application deserializes untrusted data without proper validation, this could potentially give an attacker the capability to inject harmful data and exploit your application.
Solution: To mitigate this issue, avoid deserialization of untrusted data. If this is not possible, apply context-specific, input validation.

Vulnerability: Improper Access control (CWE-284)
Issue: In Java especially, access modifiers (private, public, protected) play an essential role in securing the application data. If data or methods are exposed unintentionally by use of inappropriate access modifiers, an attacker could misuse it.
Solution: Ensure to use proper access modifiers for classes, methods and variables. Make data as 'private' as possible and minimize the scope.

Vulnerability: Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities (CWE-937)
Issue: The use of third-party libraries or other components with known vulnerabilities can expose your application to security risks.
Solution: Regularly update all third-party components and libraries. Monitor trusted sources for vulnerability disclosures related to components you use.

Vulnerability: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CWE-79)
Issue: If your application incorporates untrusted data in its HTML output, it's vulnerable to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack, which might compromise the user's session.
Solution: Always encode untrusted data to make it safe to render in HTML. Use context-specific encoding and make sure to apply the correct encoding where there's a need to reflect untrusted input.

"""
Scenario 1: Error codes are set to normal values

Details:  
  TestName: shouldSetNormalErrorCodesSuccessfully.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method will correctly set the array of error codes when normal error code values are used. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an array of ErrorCode with normal values.
  Act: Invoke setErrorCodes with the created ErrorCode array. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the errorCodes field has been set to the array we passed.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the errorCodes array is set correctly when normal values are used.
  This test is significant in checking the standard functionality of the setErrorCodes method.
  
Scenario 2: Error codes are set to null

Details:  
  TestName: shouldHandleNullErrorCodes.
  Description: This test is meant to check how the method behaves when null is passed as an argument.  
Execution:
  Arrange: No need to create any data.
  Act: Invoke setErrorCodes with null. 
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if errorCodes field is null.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the errorCodes array can be set to null.
  This test is significant for checking the robustness of setErrorCodes method.

Scenario 3: Error code array has duplicate values

Details:  
  TestName: shouldHandleDuplicateErrorCodes.
  Description: This test is meant to check how the method behaves when the array passed has duplicate values. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an array of ErrorCode with duplicate values.
  Act: Invoke setErrorCodes with the created ErrorCode array.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the errorCodes field has been set to the array with duplicates.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify the setErrorCodes array can handle duplicate values.
  This test is significant in checking if the method treats duplicate error codes correctly and doesn't neglect or cause any error during set operation.

Scenario 4: Error codes array is empty

Details:  
  TestName: shouldHandleEmptyErrorCodes.
  Description: This test is meant to check how the method behaves when an empty array is passed. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an empty array of ErrorCode.
  Act: Invoke setErrorCodes with the empty ErrorCode array.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if errorCodes field is empty.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the setErrorCodes array can be set to an empty array.
  This test is important in checking that the method can handle the case where no error codes are present.
