================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials
Issue: Potentially, the 'setSecret' method could be used to assign a hard-coded secret. Hard-coding sensitive information like passwords, secret keys, tokens, etc., can lead to exposure of sensitive information.
Solution: Avoid hard-coding secrets into your program. Secrets should be accessed through secure methods, such as environment variables or secure configuration files.

Vulnerability: CWE-359: Exposure of Private Information ('Privacy Violation')
Issue: If the secret value can be set and read indiscriminately throughout the application, it could lead to an unintentional exposure of sensitive information.
Solution: Ensure that information hiding principle in OOP is applied. Create private variables with getter and setter methods, and restrict access to sensitive data. Best practice would be never to expose sensitive data.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Valid secret is set

Details:
  TestName: setValidSecret
  Description: This test is meant to check if a valid secret string can be correctly set by the method.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and a valid secret string. 
  Act: Invoke the setSecret method with the valid secret string.
  Assert: Compare the value of secret in the class to the valid string set via setSecret.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the provided secret is accurately set within the class. This is important as secrets are often used for security purposes, therefore it's crucial they are set accurately.

Scenario 2: Null secret is set

Details:
  TestName: setNullSecret
  Description: This test checks the behavior of the setSecret method when attempting to set a null secret.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class.
  Act: Invoke the setSecret method with null as an argument.
  Assert: Compare the value of secret in the class with null.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify that the provided secret (null in this case) is accurately set within the class. This is significant in terms of handling null inputs and preventing NullPointerException.

Scenario 3: Resetting secret value

Details:
  TestName: resetSecretValue
  Description: This test checks the correctness of the method when setting a new secret value, replacing an old one.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class and set an initial secret.
  Act: Invoke the setSecret method with a new different secret.
  Assert: Compare the value of the secret in the class with the new secret, and ensure it's not equal to the initial secret.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the secret resets correctly and can replace the old value with a new one. This implies the method handles value changes correctly.

Scenario 4: Empty secret is set

Details:
  TestName: setEmptySecret
  Description: This test checks the handling of an empty string as a secret.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the class.
  Act: Invoke the setSecret method with an empty string as an argument.
  Assert: Compare the value of the secret in the class with the empty string.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the mechanism correctly handles an empty secret, and sets it as the secret. This is relevant for understanding the method's behavior with different input types.
