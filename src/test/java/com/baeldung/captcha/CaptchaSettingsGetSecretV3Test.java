ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getSecretV3_80ee813c53

================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-200: Information Exposure
Issue: Within the given code, the `getSecretV3()` method is public and could be accessed anywhere within the application or expose sensitive information if used without proper access control, contributing to an Information Exposure vulnerability (CWE-200).
Solution: Restrict the visibility of `getSecretV3()` method (e.g., by making it private) and provide a public method that controls the access to it. If it's necessary to expose it, consider following least privilege principle combined with some access control mechanism or obfuscation/encryption techniques when retrieving such keys.

================================================================================
Scenario 1: Testing behavior when retrieving SecretV3

  Details:  
    TestName: testGetSecretV3
    Description: This test is meant to check the functionality of the getSecretV3 method. It validates whether the method returns the correct value of secretV3.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required as getSecretV3 is a getter method.
    Act: Invoke the getSecretV3 method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned value against expected value of secretV3.
  Validation: 
    Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: This test verifies that the method correctly returns the expected value of secretV3. 
    Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: Getter methods like getSecretV3 are crucial for keeping the application's state consistent. By ensuring they return correct values, we ensure reliable and predictable application behavior.

Scenario 2: Testing the identity and state of returned secretV3
  
  Details:  
    TestName: testReturnedSecretV3Identity
    Description: This test will check the identity and state of the object returned by the getSecretV3 method.
  Execution:
    Arrange: No setup is required as getSecretV3 is a getter method.
    Act: Invoke the getSecretV3 method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to ensure that the returned object is indeed secretV3 and not an altered or new instance. 
  Validation:
    Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: This test verifies that the method returns the correct instance of secretV3, thereby preserving identity and state.
    Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: It is important to ensure that getter methods do not create new objects or alter their state, which would otherwise confuse other parts of application depending on secretV3.

Scenario 3: Testing for null reference

  Details:  
    TestName: testNullSecretV3
    Description: This test is intended to check the getSecretV3 method when the secretV3 reference is null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set the secretV3 reference to null.
    Act: Call the getSecretV3 method.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to verify that the returned value is null.
  Validation: 
    Clarify what the assertion aims to verify: This test verifies that the method can handle null references correctly without throwing an exception.
    Elaborate on the significance of the test in the context of application behavior or business logic: Factoring in how the method deals with null reference is a good practice to make sure of the robustness of the application under unusual or edge-case scenarios.
