================================VULNERABILITIES================================
Vulnerability: CWE-598: Information Exposure Through Query Strings in GET Request
Issue: Using GET request exposes sensitive information to third party logs, browser history and might be vulnerable to other threats when information is insecurely handled in the logs.
Solution: Instead of exposing secret properties in GET request, use POST method or store such properties as environment variables or use other secure methods for sensitive data.

Vulnerability: CWE-524: Information Exposure Through Debug Information
Issue: The usage of debug information in error messages when exceptions are thrown might leak sensitive information.
Solution: Ensure proper exception handling, and avoid exposing sensitive information in debug information or error messages. Use a custom error page or a global error handler which catch any detail about the error and show a standardized error message.

Vulnerability: CWE-807: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Pages Generation
Issue: Injections attack can come in the form of inputs during page generations.
Solution: Validate and sanitize all incoming data before passing it to any API or including it in an SQL statement. Make use of java's existing api to escape html, js and other contents.

Vulnerability: CWE-525: Information Exposure Through Browser Caching
Issue: Sensitive data might be exposed through local caching on a client's machine.
Solution: Ensure that caching is controlled or disabled for pages containing sensitive information. It's possible to control browser caching using response headers such as pragma, cache-control and expires.

"""
Scenario 1: Test to verify that the 'getSecret' method returns the correct data.

  Details:
    TestName: getSecretReturnsCorrectData.
    Description: This scenario is meant to check if the 'getSecret' method is returning the correct value of the 'secret' property. The expected behaviour is that it returns the value assigned to the 'secret' property. 

  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement necessary for this test as it deals with a getter method. 
    Act: To begin, call the 'getSecret' method and store the result.
    Assert: Compare the returned value against the expected value using appropriate JUnit assertion. 

  Validation:
    This assertion aims to verify that the 'getSecret' method is returning accurate data. The expected result is justified because the method is supposed to return the value of 'secret'. It is crucial to ensure that methods operate correctly as they're used extensively across the application.


Scenario 2: Test to verify that 'getSecret' method returns null if 'secret' is not pointed to any object/variable.

  Details:
    TestName: getSecretReturnsNullIfNotInitialized.
    Description: The test is meant to ensure that the 'getSecret' method returns null if 'secret' is not initialized. It means 'secret' has not been assigned a value.
    
  Execution:
    Arrange: No arrangement necessary for this test as it deals with a getter method. 
    Act: Simply call the 'getSecret' method and store the result.
    Assert: Compare the returned value with null using the appropriate JUnit assertion (assertEquals). 

  Validation:
    This assertion is meant to validate that 'getSecret' returns null when 'secret' is not initialized. This result is expected because a reference type variable would return null if it's not initialized or pointing to anything. Any misbehaviour might lead to misleading information within the system.


Scenario 3: Test to verify that the 'getSecret' method returns an empty string if 'secret' has been initialized but not assigned a value. 

  Details:
    TestName: getSecretReturnsEmptyIfNotAssigned.
    Description: This test is meant to check if the 'getSecret' method correctly returns an empty string if 'secret' is initialized but has no assigned value.

  Execution:
    Arrange: Initialize 'secret' as an empty string. 
    Act: Call the 'getSecret' method and store the result. 
    Assert: Compare the returned value with an empty string using the appropriate JUnit assertion (assertEquals).

  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that 'getSecret' returns an empty string when 'secret' is not assigned any value after initialization. This test case is significant to ensure that the getter method operates correctly even when the 'secret' variable is blank.
